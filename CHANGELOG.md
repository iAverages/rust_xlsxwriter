## [0.36.0] - 2023-04-18

### Added

- Added performance improvement for applications that use a lot of `Format`
  objects. [GitHub Issue #30].


### Fixed

- Fixed issue introduced in v0.34.0 where `Rc<>` value was blocking `Send` in
  multithreaded applications. [GitHub Issue #29].

[GitHub Issue #30]: https://github.com/jmcnamara/rust_xlsxwriter/issues/30


## [0.35.0] - 2023-04-16

### Added

- Added support for Chart Series data labels including custom data labels. See
  [`ChartDataLabel`], [`chart.series.set_data_label()`] and [`chart.series.set_custom_data_labels()`].

## [0.34.0] - 2023-04-12

### Added

Performance improvement release.

- Added optimizations across the library. For larger files this version is 10%
  faster than previous versions.

  These optimizations were provided by Adri√°n Delgado, see [GitHub Issue #23].

- Added crate feature `zlib` which adds a dependency on zlib and a C compiler
  but is around 1.6x faster for larger files. With this feature enabled it is
  even faster than the native C version libxlsxwriter by around 1.4x for large
  files.

  See also the [Performance] section of the user guide.

## [0.33.0] - 2023-04-10

### Added

- Added support for formatting and setting chart points via the [`ChartPoint`]
  struct. This is mainly useful as the way of specifying segment colors in Pie
  charts.

  See the updated [Pie Chart] example in the user guide.

- Added support for formatting and setting chart markers via the [`ChartMarker`]
  struct.

- Added [`chart.set_rotation()`] and [`chart.set_hole_size()`] methods for Pie and Doughnut charts.

- Added support to differentiate between `XlsxColor::Default` and
  `XlsxColor::Automatic` colors for Excel elements. These are usually equivalent
  but there are some cases where the "Automatic" color, which can be set at a
  system level, is different from the Default color.

## [0.32.0] - 2023-04-03

### Added

- Added formatting for the chart title and axes via the the [`ChartFormat`]
  struct.

## [0.31.0] - 2023-04-02

### Added

- Added formatting for the chart area, plot area, and legend via the the
  [`ChartFormat`] struct.


## [0.30.0] - 2023-03-31

### Added

- Added chart formatting for Lines, Borders, Solid fills and Pattern fills via
  the [`ChartFormat`] struct. This is currently only available for chart series
  but it will be extended in the next release for most other chart elements.

  See also the [Chart Fill Pattern] example in the user guide.

- Added [`IntoColor`] trait to allow syntactic shortcuts for [`XlsxColor`]
  parameters in methods. So now you can set a RGB color like this
  `object.set_color("#FF7F50")` instead of the more verbose
  `object.set_color(XlsxColor::RGB(0xFF7F50))`. This addition doesn't require
  any API changes from the end user.

- Added [`worksheet.insert_image_fit_to_cell()`] method to add an image to a
  worksheet and scale it so that it fits in a cell. This method can be useful
  when creating a product spreadsheet with a column of images for each product.

  See also the [insert_image_to_fit] example in the user guide.

- Added [`chart.series.set_gap()`] and [`chart.series.set_overlap()`] method to control layout
  of histogram style charts.

## [0.29.0] - 2023-03-16

### Added

- Added support for resizing and object positioning to the [`Chart`] struct.

- Added handling for `chrono` date/time types to the generic
  [`worksheet.write()`] method.


## [0.28.0] - 2023-03-14

### Added

- Added support for positioning or hiding Chart legends. See [`ChartLegend`].

[`ChartLegend`]: https://docs.rs/rust_xlsxwriter/latest/rust_xlsxwriter/struct.ChartLegend.html


## [0.27.0] - 2023-03-13

### Added

- Added support for Charts via the [`Chart`] struct and the
  [`worksheet.insert_chart()`] method. See also the [Chart Examples] in the user
  guide.

- Added a generic [`worksheet.write()`] method that writes string or number
  types. This will be extended in an upcoming release to provide a single
  `write()` method for all of the currently supported types.

  It also allows the user to extend [`worksheet.write()`] to handle user defined
  types via the [`IntoExcelData`] trait. See also the [Writing Generic data]
  example in the user guide.

## [0.26.0] - 2023-02-03

  Note: this version contains a major refactoring/renaming of some of the main
  data writing functions and some of the enums and secondary structs. This will
  require code changes from all current users but will allow more consistent
  APIs in future releases. Nevertheless, I apologize for this level of change.


### Changed

- The following worksheet functions have changed names to reflect their
  frequency of usage.

  | Previous name                        | New name                                    |
  | :----------------------------------- | :------------------------------------------ |

  | `write_dynamic_array_formula_only()` | `write_dynamic_array_formula()`             |
  |                                      |                                             |
  | `write_array_formula()`              | `write_array_formula_with_format()`         |

  | `write_rich_string()`                | `write_rich_string_with_format()`           |
  | `write_string()`                     | `write_string_with_format()`                |


- The following enums and structs have changed to a more logical naming:

  | Previous name              | New name                |
  | :------------------------- | :---------------------- |
  | `XlsxAlign`                | `FormatAlign`           |
  | `XlsxBorder`               | `FormatBorder`          |
  | `XlsxDiagonalBorder`       | `FormatDiagonalBorder`  |

  | `ProtectWorksheetOptions`  | `ProtectionOptions`     |
  | `Properties`               | `DocProperties`         |


- The `DocProperties::set_custom_property()` method replaces several type
  specific methods with a single trait based generic method.


## [0.25.0] - 2023-01-30

### Added

- Added ability to filter columns in [`worksheet.autofilter()`] ranges via
  [`worksheet.filter_column()`] and [`FilterCondition`].

  criteria. This is an additional feature that isn't available in the other
  language ports of "xlsxwriter".

  See also the [Working with Autofilters] section of the Users Guide.

  an image, moves when the cells underneath it are moved, resized or deleted.

## [0.9.0] - 2022-10-31

**Note, this version contains a major backward incompatible API change where it
restructures the Workbook constructor/destructor sequence and introduces a
`save()` method to replace `close()`.**

### Changed

- The [`Workbook::new()`] method no longer takes a filename. Instead the naming
  of the file has move to a [`workbook.save()`] method which replaces
  `workbook.close()`.
- There are now supporting [`workbook.save_to_path()`] and
  [`workbook.save_to_buffer()`] methods.

### Added

- Added new methods to get references to worksheet objects used by the workbook:

  - [`workbook.worksheet_from_name()`]
  - [`workbook.worksheet_from_index()`]
  - [`workbook.worksheets_mut()`]

- Made the [`Worksheet::new()`] method public and added the
  [`workbook.push_worksheet()`] to add Worksheet instances to a Workbook. See
  also the `rust_xlsxwriter` documentation on [Creating Worksheets] and working
  with the borrow checker.
